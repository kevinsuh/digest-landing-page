# Summary
SMS-based knowledge assistant that accepts any URL via text, saves it for offline consumption, categorizes and summarizes it, then delivers audio summaries (to consume asynchronously, eg at the gym) to help you follow through with your intentions.

Turn your commute time into learning time with Digest.

# Painpoints
* Consolidation of content
	* Mobile in-app browser across apps; can't save things (can't even login)
	* Isolated bookmarks across apps; no consolidation
* Organizing / categorizing your content
* Actually consuming/learning from your content
	* Actually find time to read it; original content is too long, need to sit down and read it, etc. (Pocket, Substack all have this problem)
	* Pocket let you save but you never opened it; just articles buried away with no knowledge management support
	* Hard to save notes and patterns, actually learning from what you want to for later

# Market Opportunity/Research
- 30% of people identify as having "tab hoarding" problems
- Apps will never share bookmarks; in-app browser forces new session every time
- Pocket shutdown July 2025 (last month); no primary apps here
- Content aggregation solutions today focus on desktop with chrome extensions and highlighting tools; but mobile is where content discovery is actually done

# Solution (features)
## MVP
* SMS / email forwarding of URLs
	* Core categorization: Twitter, online article, etc.
	* Summary of content
	* Source content (URL, text if possible)
	* SMS response on save, and follow-up for activity
* Web dashboard
	- View saved content, summary and patterns
	- Make summary reading easy
- Audio files and recordings
	- Manage status here; read/unread
	- Core features to make "consumption management" easy

Pricing: $10/month
- Think through volume-based / premium user pricing here

## Post-MVP
- Integration with Notion / Obsidian
- Custom categories
- Custom prompts
- Ad-hoc analysis and summary capabilities
- Social sharing (growth hacks)
- Mobile app for eg easier audio recording

* JTBD Forces
	* Push
		* Information overload "constant anxiety about unread content"
		* Stale knowledge management tolls "no organization system could keep up"
			* "Couldn't remember why I saved things"
			* "Information became meaningless without context/connection"
		* Consistent consumption "no time for dedicated reading; intentions never materialized"
		* Keep up with trends "fear of missing knowledge, seeming uninformed"
	* Pull
		* Effortless and universal capture "no new apps to learn, existing behavior"
		* Intelligent processing "AI does the analysis, categorization and pattern recognition"
		* Guilt / FOMO reduction "getting value without full reading to eliminate information anxiety"
			* "Audio summaries during commute; info during dead time"
	* Anxiety (why not this solution)
		* Summaries might miss the nuance
		* Fear of losing out of info by just pushing it down to a text
		* Depending on a new system to hold favorites/bookmarks
	* Habit (why just keep status quo)
		* Hoarding is actually the itch I want to scratch, not consuming
		* I already have my existing tools/workflows
		* Keeping the full articles and source content means I won't miss nuance; I just need to work harder to actually consume them

TLDR targeting
* When I feel overwhelmed or anxious by actually consuming information I find online on the go, I can effortlessly send a text to get the summary and remember to process it later. I will have support to make sure I learn what I intended to.
